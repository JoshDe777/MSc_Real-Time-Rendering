Light grid system ideated using ChatGPT
- ChatGPT was also involved throughout the project to help pinpoint issues during debugging, and suggest targeted fixes.

- Lighting shaders made in part using the tutorial "OpenGL with C++ 09: Blinn Phong Lighting" by GetIntoGameDev (https://youtu.be/wlafIxgiuRY?si=tcnuTEgUJ96BzNWL)
- Assimp support established using assimp's documentation.
- 3D Mesh inclusion made primarily using resources made available on blackboard, on top of the existing systems.

### External Assets:
- [Minotaur asset modified from "Hell Minotaur" asset made by VMMI](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/hell-minotaur-ca4d8d67d5404b1dafdda0ecbba7aad9)
- Textures from PolyHaven:
    - 'Gravelly Sand' texture from [PolyHaven](https://polyhaven.com/a/gravelly_sand) - Dario Barresi
    - 'Wood Inlaid Stone Wall' texture from [PolyHaven](https://polyhaven.com/a/wood_inlaid_stone_wall) - Amal Kumar

The entire system builds on the work made during my GameLab III module in my undergraduate studies. A finished state of the software before start on this project can be found at https://github.com/JoshDe777/gamelab3-ocean_outlaws

For transparency, a commit history (and the full source code) is available at https://github.com/JoshDe777/MSc-CompGraphics
